# Python Projects

## Day 1

### String Concatenation and printing name

The program takes two strings as an input from the user and as output gives a concatenation of both strings.
The program also explain how to `input()` and `print()` it in one line of code.

### Swap

Using two integer values using a third variable
Using two integer values without a third variable

## Day 2

### Dinner Table Per Individual Contribution

The program takes the bill amount `amt` for dining with your `num_friends` friends along with the `tip` to be paid to the waiter - from the user.

It calculates the `total_amt` to be paid at the restaurant and the divides by `num_friends` and gives `individual_amt` to be paid.

### Your lifetime is finite

[Inspiration](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).
This program takes an input `age` and returns the number of years, months and weeks you have lived.

## Day 3

### Leap Year

The program check wether the entered year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except it is divisible be 100 unless also divisible by 400.

## Day 4

### Banker's Roulette

The program takes a string of `names`, converts it into an array and uses a random function to draw out the name of the person who pays for tonight's dinner.
This is Banker's Roulette because this is a classic case of how bankers pay for their lunch/ dinner. When the waiter arrives with the bill, the bankers collect their credit cards in a hat and the waiter randomly picks out a card from the had. Whose card is drawn they pay for all.

### Rock Paper Scissor

Yes. The exact Rock Paper Scissor you used to play with a friend. But here, you can play with the computer.

## Day 5

### Password Generator

This program takes three inputs.

- `length`: of the password
- `nums`: Number of numbers to be included
- `special_char`: Number of special characters  
  It generates a random password based on an input. Go on! Use it to generate a random un-hackable password ever.

## Day 6

For and while loops.

## Day 7

### Hangman

This program replicates the game of Hangman. Here, you have to guess a word. Every successful guess will reveal you the characters in the word. Every unsuccessful guess loses a life. You have seven lives to guess the correct word.
If you guess the correct characters and find the word, YOU WIN. If not, you hang the man and you lose.

## Day 8

### Prime Numbers

- To check wether a given number is prime or not, we find the remainder of the given number by finding the modulus `%` by dividing it from 2 to `number-1`.
- If for any of number ranging between 2 and `number-1`, the remainder is zero, this means that the `ith` number completely divides the given number `num`. This implies that the `ith` number is a factor of `num`. By definition, prime numbers only have 1 and the number itself as its factors. Hence, `num` is not a prime number.
- If there remainder for the range of 2 to `number-1` is not zero, `num` is a prime number.

### Caesar Cipher

- Caesar Cipher is an encryption and decryption algorithm. This program creates a simple encryption and decryption program that encrypts and decrypts a text message using a given key.

## Day 9

### Silent Auction

This program takes username and biding price from the user and stores it in a python dictionary. As oiuput, it displays the maxumum bidder - the name and amount.

## Day 10

### Days in a Month

This program takes the `year` and `month` as an input and displays the number of days in the month, including the additional day of February in a leap year.

## Day 11

## BlackJack Game

[Inspiration](https://www.247blackjack.com/).
This is a simple version of a BlackJack between a Dealer (Computer) and a Player(You). Here you draw 2 cards initially and have an option to draw more cards to reach greater than or equal to the unknown sum of cards of the Dealer.
