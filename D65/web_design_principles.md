## Web Design Pillars

1. User Interface Design - Use hierarchy, layout, alignment, white space and design for user
2. User Experience Design - Simplicity, consistency, reading patterns (most common is the F, Z, type pattern), all platform design and avoid dark patterns
3. Color Theory - use color wheel to find Analogous or Complementary Colors
4. Typography - Serif family (have feet at the end): Serious, authoritative and older. Sans Serif (ends are at right angle): Friendly, approachable, novel and contemporary.
