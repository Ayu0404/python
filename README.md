(Angela Yu - 100 Days of Python)[https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=Search_DSA_Alpha_Prof_la.EN_cc.India&campaigntype=Search&portfolio=India&language=EN&product=Course&test=&audience=DSA&topic=Python&priority=Alpha&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_160270535025_._ad_696202838298_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-1705455366924_._li_9061702_._pd__._&matchtype=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgL-3BhDnARIsAL6KZ6-gBZq5o46yYS9P0TztZNpsi2dOg0qkKPERpx6nDPiYixRanPK2KzwaAjJGEALw_wcB]

## Day 1

### String Concatenation and printing name

The program takes two strings as an input from the user and as output gives a concatenation of both strings.
The program also explain how to `input()` and `print()` it in one line of code.

### Swap

Using two integer values using a third variable
Using two integer values without a third variable

## Day 2

### Dinner Table Per Individual Contribution

The program takes the bill amount `amt` for dining with your `num_friends` friends along with the `tip` to be paid to the waiter - from the user.

It calculates the `total_amt` to be paid at the restaurant and the divides by `num_friends` and gives `individual_amt` to be paid.

### Your lifetime is finite

[Inspiration](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).
This program takes an input `age` and returns the number of years, months and weeks you have lived.

## Day 3

### Leap Year

The program check wether the entered year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except it is divisible be 100 unless also divisible by 400.

## Day 4

### Banker's Roulette

The program takes a string of `names`, converts it into an array and uses a random function to draw out the name of the person who pays for tonight's dinner.
This is Banker's Roulette because this is a classic case of how bankers pay for their lunch/ dinner. When the waiter arrives with the bill, the bankers collect their credit cards in a hat and the waiter randomly picks out a card from the had. Whose card is drawn they pay for all.

### Rock Paper Scissor

Yes. The exact Rock Paper Scissor you used to play with a friend. But here, you can play with the computer.

## Day 5

### Password Generator

This program takes three inputs.

- `length`: of the password
- `nums`: Number of numbers to be included
- `special_char`: Number of special characters  
  It generates a random password based on an input. Go on! Use it to generate a random un-hackable password ever.

## Day 6

For and while loops.

## Day 7

### Hangman

This program replicates the game of Hangman. Here, you have to guess a word. Every successful guess will reveal you the characters in the word. Every unsuccessful guess loses a life. You have seven lives to guess the correct word.
If you guess the correct characters and find the word, YOU WIN. If not, you hang the man and you lose.

## Day 8

### Prime Numbers

- To check wether a given number is prime or not, we find the remainder of the given number by finding the modulus `%` by dividing it from 2 to `number-1`.
- If for any of number ranging between 2 and `number-1`, the remainder is zero, this means that the `ith` number completely divides the given number `num`. This implies that the `ith` number is a factor of `num`. By definition, prime numbers only have 1 and the number itself as its factors. Hence, `num` is not a prime number.
- If there remainder for the range of 2 to `number-1` is not zero, `num` is a prime number.

### Caesar Cipher

- Caesar Cipher is an encryption and decryption algorithm. This program creates a simple encryption and decryption program that encrypts and decrypts a text message using a given key.

## Day 9

### Silent Auction

This program takes username and biding price from the user and stores it in a python dictionary. As oiuput, it displays the maxumum bidder - the name and amount.

## Day 10

### Days in a Month

This program takes the `year` and `month` as an input and displays the number of days in the month, including the additional day of February in a leap year.

## Day 11

## BlackJack Game

[Inspiration](https://www.247blackjack.com/).
This is a simple version of a BlackJack between a Dealer (Computer) and a Player(You). Here you draw 2 cards initially and have an option to draw more cards to reach greater than or equal to the unknown sum of cards of the Dealer.

## Day 12

## Number Guessing

This program has two levels

- Easy: You get 10 chances to guess a number between 1 and 100
- Hard: You get 5 chances to guess a number between 1 and 100

## Day 13

## Ways of Debugging

1. Describe the problem - by asking questions. What is the problem? Why is the problem occurring? What am I missing? What am I assuming?
2. Reproduce the bug - Run it again and again. When does that error occur again?
3. Act like the interpreter - (or compiler - based on the programming language you are using). Break it down to very minute and logical condition.
4. Fix the error - When working on an editor, when you hover over a curly line under your code - like like a syntax error, fix it. Follow the programming rules, logic, syntax, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to fix.
5. Use display statements - to display out on console/ webpage. Use them a lot while debugging.
6. Debugger and Breakpoints - To hover over line by line of code and check it in real execution time. Breakpoint is a point where the code stops in real time - for you to explore and debug.
7. Take a break - Step away. Go for a walk. Sleep on it and tackle it tomorrow.
8. Ask someone - A fellow developer, a colleague or a friend.
9. Run - Run the code after solving one smaller problem. Don't compile it all together and wait to run in the end.

## Day 14

### Higher Lower

[Inspiration](http://www.higherlowergame.com/)
This program provides you with two choices. If you select the correct choice according to the popularity of the celebrity, you gain a score. If not, you lose.

## Day 15

### Coffee Machine

Your regular coffee machine serving you espresso/latte/cappuccino. Just like a machine, it has existing resources (milk, coffee and water) and checks wether it can prepare coffee for you. You also need to pay the machine in coins to successfully oder coffee.

# Day 16

Introducation to classes and objects. Rebuilding coffe machine in a class.

## Day 17

### Quiz

A True/ False quiz that takes answers from a user and displays user score. The program is implemented to demonstrate OOP - Object Oriented Programing Concepts.
