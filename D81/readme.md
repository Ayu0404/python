Introspection

What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

Hard - Coming up with one liner logic
Easy - Writing a naive/ basic solution
Scope of Improvement - Be aware of list and string methods to be able to think towards writing one liner solutions.
Learning - Using key value pairs in a dictionary
Doing it differently again - I would be aware of existing string and list methods. Then write clean and efficient code with comparitively more knowledge
