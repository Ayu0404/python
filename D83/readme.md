Introspection

What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

Hard - Breaking down a bigger problem to smaller problems
Easy - writing logic
Scope of Improvement - Writing more neat and efficient code
Learning - touch down on basics - loops and if/else
Doing it differently again - focus more on modularity
